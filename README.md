# Education-Service

### Project Overview

1. **Objective:**
   - Create a REST service for an education website using Spring Boot, focusing on Representational State Transfer (REST) principles.

2. **Technologies Used:**
   - Utilize Spring Boot as the framework for developing RESTful services.
   - Require JDK 1.8+, an IDE, and Maven 3.0+ for project completion.

### Key Concepts

3. **Richardson Maturity Model:**
   - Familiarity with the Richardson Maturity Model is essential for assessing the maturity level of the Restful Web Service.

4. **RESTful Services Constraints:**
   - Adhere to REST architectural constraints, including cacheable results, statelessness, presence of a producer and a service consumer, and uniform URL.

### Implementation Details

5. **Web Framework:**
   - Use Spring Web MVC as the web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.

6. **Project Bootstrapping:**
   - Bootstrap the project using Spring Initializr, selecting dependencies such as DevTools, Actuator, Web, Artifact, and Group.

7. **Data Storage:**
   - Employ an in-memory store (e.g., "ArrayList") for managing data within the service.

8. **Request Methods:**
   - Implement varying request methods, including DELETE, POST, PUT, and GET, to handle different functionalities within the education site.

### Learning Opportunities

9. **Skill Enhancement:**
   - Gain hands-on experience with Spring Boot, REST, and the implementation of RESTful services.

10. **Understanding Request Methods:**
    - Develop proficiency in utilizing different HTTP request methods to perform specific actions within the education site.

### How to Get Started

11. **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure JDK 1.8+, an IDE, and Maven 3.0+ are installed on your development environment.

12. **Project Initialization:**
    - Use Spring Initializr to initiate the project with the recommended dependencies.

13. **Explore REST Concepts:**
    - Delve into the Richardson Maturity Model and understand the core principles of RESTful services.

### Conclusion
